"""Pinning a peer's post-quantum identity — the thing that makes requiring PQ mean anything.

Without a pinned PQ key, `verify_hybrid` reads `pq_public_key` out of the signature object, so the
PQ layer is useless against the only adversary it exists for: one who can forge Ed25519 forges it
against the pinned classical key and attaches an ML-DSA keypair of their own. A post-quantum
signature is worth exactly what the pinning of its public key is worth.

Two properties are load-bearing here and neither is obvious:

* **First sight is the only chance.** The pin has to be recorded while classical signatures can
  still authenticate it. A PQ key first seen after Ed25519 falls cannot be attributed to anyone,
  which is why the crawler records it on the first crawl rather than waiting for enforcement.

* **A changed PQ key is recorded, not rejected.** Rejecting would quarantine every legitimate
  rotation, including the ones this fleet causes itself — a component whose key path is not on a
  volume regenerates its ML-DSA key on every container recreate. Enforcement belongs to
  `AIMARKET_PQC_REQUIRE`, which already gates the verification policy.

And one regression guard: the `peers` upsert names its columns in three separate lists, and the
code says so — a column present in one and missing from another blanks itself on every crawl and
reads back as `""` with no error anywhere.
