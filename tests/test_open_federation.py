# `AIMARKET_FEDERATION_OPEN` reads, in config.py, as the gate on both open doors:
# "When on, two doors open — POST /federation/announce accepts an unauthenticated
# announcement; a peer that crawls THIS hub identifies itself via X-AIMarket-Crawler and is
# recorded from that alone."  Neither door ever consulted it. It gated only the crawler's
# manifest PREVIEW and a reported status flag, so an operator who left it at its default 0 —
# believing open federation was off — still ran an open door, and with
# AIMARKET_FEDERATION_ASSAY and AIMARKET_FEDERATION_AUTO_ADMIT both defaulting on, all the
# way through to a stranger being trusted with no operator click.
#
# The dedicated cap `federation_open_max_pending` (default 50) was referenced nowhere in the
# package; both doors passed `federation_gossip_max_observed` (default 2000) instead.
