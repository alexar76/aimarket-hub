"""A peer's escrow reaches a stranger two hops away, without an operator in the loop.

The federation is cyclic, so a monitor stops at the second hop and never fetches a peer's
peers. That is what bounds the graph — and it is why a hub over there used to arrive as a
name and a number, with nothing about it that could be checked. So each hub re-exports
what its peers declared: the peer's escrow travels with the peers list, and the reader can
go and look at the chain itself.

"Without an operator in the loop" is the property under test. The declaration is re-read
on EVERY crawl, so a peer that deploys an escrow tomorrow is re-exported with one on the
next pass, and a peer that withdraws it stops being re-exported with one. There is no env
var to set and no admin action, because a step an operator has to remember is a step that
does not happen.
