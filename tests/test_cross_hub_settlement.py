"""Two hubs, one sale: the buyer pays A, A pays B, everybody's books balance.

This is the gap that made federation a catalogue rather than a supply chain. A routed
invoke could not carry payment to the other side at all: the buyer's `X-Payment-Channel` is
meaningless on the peer's ledger, so the router called peers as a shared free-tier visitor,
and a peer that actually charged answered `402` — which was handed back to a buyer who has
no account there and no way to act on it. The one alternative,
`AIMARKET_PEER_PAYMENT_CHANNEL`, is a single global string, and channel ids are hub-local,
so it cannot be right for more than one peer.

The fix is a credit key per peer. The routing hub becomes a reseller with settlement: it
pays the peer out of its own account there, bills the buyer the catalogued price, and keeps
the routing fee as the spread. Consent is the key the peer issued — unlike
`AIMARKET_SELLS_FOR`, which declares this hub the seller of somebody else's work with no
consent anywhere.

Both hubs here are real apps in one process; the router's outbound HTTP is redirected into
the upstream's own TestClient, so the money really moves through two independent ledgers.
