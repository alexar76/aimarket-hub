"""What a hub publishes about its own money, and what it re-exports about a peer's.

`.well-known/ai-market.json` used to say `supported_chains: ["base"]` and
`payment_configured: true` with no address anywhere in the document, so the only way to
find out whether a hub had ever settled anything was to send it money. The escrow and the
settlement wallet are already visible to anyone who transacts here (every channel open
names the escrow; every x402 `accepts[].payTo` names the wallet), so publishing them
discloses nothing new — it just means a reader can check first.

The tests that matter here are the ones about NOT publishing: a sealed realm must never
name a real asset, a hub that credits any tx_hash must not point at a wallet as if money
arriving there were verified, and a bubble must not hand out explorer links to a chain
that has never heard of its contracts.
