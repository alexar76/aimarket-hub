"""A free trial buys a result, not an attempt.

Measured on production before this existed. A caller sending the documented envelope but
omitting ``source_hub`` got five straight refusals, each carrying the exact hint needed to
fix the call — ``fourier.spectrum@v1 is federated, not local — retry with source_hub=...`` —
and the sixth was refused for ``trial_quota_exhausted``, ``used 5 / max 5``. Five helpful
error messages, zero results, allowance gone. The same happened through a plugin block
(``403 plugin_blocked_response``).

The hub already had the right discipline for money and the wrong one for the free tier. Its
own comment on the paid path says a hold is taken "before the peer is asked to do anything"
so that "a peer that 402s, times out or returns garbage never costs the buyer anything",
and it counts nine exits between reservation and response. The free tier was debited at the
door with no release.

Two changes are covered here:

* the debit moved to *after* validation, so the eight refusals that precede any execution
  attempt cannot spend anything;
* the ledger gained ``release``, paired in the same ``finally`` that hands back the payment
  hold, for the exits after execution begins.
