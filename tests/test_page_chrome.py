"""The public HTML pages must look like one site, and must not hand out unowned pip names.

Two things drifted before this file existed:

* `/developers`, `/examples` and `/plugins/demo` each carried a private stylesheet, so following
  a link off the terminal home page landed on a page in a different visual language entirely.
  `theme.py` is now the one source of that chrome, and the checks below are about the pages
  actually using it — a page that stops linking `/assets/site.css` renders unstyled, and nothing
  else in the suite would notice.

* `plugins-demo.html` printed `pip install <plugin name>` for every plugin the hub had loaded,
  built from the live catalogue. Ten of those names are unpublished, and one of them is the bare
  word `provenance`, which belongs to a stranger. `test_landing_install_lines.py` guards the same
  class of bug on the landing page; this guards the demo page, where the command is generated at
  runtime instead of written in the HTML.
