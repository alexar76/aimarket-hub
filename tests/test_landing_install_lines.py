"""The landing page must never tell a stranger to `pip install` a name we do not own.

On 2026-07-30 https://modelmarket.dev/examples was public, returned 200, and handed visitors 18
`pip install <name>` commands. Ten of those names were unregistered on PyPI:

    aimarket-provenance  aimarket-auction     aimarket-personas   aimarket-data-cap
    aimarket-nft         aimarket-orchestrator aimarket-streaming aimarket-promo
    aimarket-dataset     aimarket-zk

Anyone could have registered any of them — the `aimarket-*` prefix is now a coherent, visible
namespace with a live marketplace behind it, which is exactly what makes it worth squatting — and
every visitor following our own documentation would then have executed their setup.py. The page also
claimed "All 15 plugins installable via pip", which was false: 8 of the 18 were.

This repo has already been on the receiving end of the same class of bug from the other direction:
`pip install oracles/chronos` in a clean environment fetched a stranger's `oracle-core`. That was
the benign version — the stranger's package was harmless and the import failed loudly. A claimed
`aimarket-*` name would not fail loudly.

So the rule this file enforces is: an install command in customer-facing HTML names either a
distribution we have published, or a path in the repository. Nothing else. It is a static check —
no network — so it cannot flake, and it is deliberately about the HTML rather than about PyPI: the
question is not "is this name free today" but "are we telling people to fetch something we do not
control".
