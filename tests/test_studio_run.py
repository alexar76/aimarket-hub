"""The studio's run path is a forwarder, and forwarders are where SSRF lives.

The studio is served by the hub because the manifest it composes from is here and the hub's
CORS is fail-closed. The pipeline executor, though, is a different service, and a browser
cannot reach it cross-origin — so the hub forwards one specific request to one specific
place.

Every test below exists to keep it *that* narrow:

  * the destination comes from the hub's own environment, never from the request body. A
    forwarder that takes its target from the caller is an SSRF gadget whatever it is named,
    and this one would be reachable unauthenticated from any browser.
  * unconfigured is a refusal with a reason, not a default guess at some localhost port.
  * the body is shape- and size-checked here as well as by the executor, so the route
    cannot be repurposed into a general-purpose poster.
