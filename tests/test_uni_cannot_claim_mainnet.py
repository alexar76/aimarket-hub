"""A sealed-bubble hub must not advertise a real payment rail.

`payment_testnet` appears exactly once in the codebase — in
`/.well-known/ai-market.json`. That makes it the one field a crawler can use to tell a real
rail from a simulated one, and `uni.modelmarket.dev` was getting it wrong: it served
`payment_testnet: false` with `supported_chains: ["base"]` and the live hub's own name while
running on Anvil chain 31337 with virtual amounts. `deploy_uni_hub.sh` warns about exactly
that in its header; the env said mainnet and nothing checked it against the realm.
