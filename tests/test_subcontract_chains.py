"""Where subcontracting meets routing and delegation (mandates.md §5.4, §6), end to end.

The SUB/1 and AMD/1 suites pin each mechanism on its own: a grant-funded child routed to a
peer, one delegated mandate paying for a local child, the allowance proxy's routing-fee debit
as a unit. What they leave open is where the mechanisms meet. Each property below is driven
through the HTTP app with real signed mandates, real job tokens and a fake peer on the
outbound transport, and each would fail if the line it names were removed or inverted:

* nothing that ties a call to this hub's job crosses to a peer — not the job token, the
  grant (a bearer secret for the buyer's allowance), the job and node ids, nor a mandate's
  agent and principal — whether the routed call is a root or a child, however this hub bills
  the peer and over either transport it can reach it by, while the same kind of call executed
  locally does receive them, so none of these checks passes vacuously;
* a job paid under a two-mandate chain counts its root, its children and their routing fees
  against BOTH mandates, and whichever mandate has less room left bounds the whole job;
* the routing-fee paths out of an allowance the existing tests never drive: a fee the
  allowance cannot cover, a routed child that fails and must have its price AND fee back in
  the allowance in time for a retry, and a brokered peer's fee debited after the fact.
