#
# v1 is the original field set. v2 additionally binds the fields a Pay-on-Verified
# money outcome is *justified* by — the delivery verdict, the audit score, the bar
# applied, and the settlement's own resolution — which v1 left outside the
# signature: a stored or forwarded envelope's stated REASONS were unauthenticated
# while its verdict was, so a relay could rewrite "why" without breaking the
# signature and a dispute would be argued from tampered evidence.
#
# The version travels in the signature block AND inside the v2 canonical itself
# (`|v:2|`), so it is bound by the signature rather than merely asserted next to it, and
# it is ABSENT for v1 — every byte a previously-signed receipt/envelope carries is
# unchanged and still verifies.
#
# Receipts cannot simply be flipped to v2 everywhere: `receipt_canonical` v1 is a
# cross-package interop shape (oracle_core, platon and the protocol test vectors all
# mirror the 7-field v1 string), so a plain invoke receipt MUST stay v1 or external
# verifiers reject it. But leaving the choice to each call site is what left the hub
# split-brained: `verified_settlement` signed its rejection receipt at v2 while
# `safety_gate.build_rejection_receipt` and the api's plugin-block receipt signed
# byte-identical evidence at v1, where every v1 field on a rejection is a constant and
# the signature therefore authenticated nothing about WHY the money came back.
#
# The version is therefore no longer a per-call-site default: `sign_receipt` DERIVES it
# from the receipt's own content (`resolve_receipt_version`). A receipt that carries any
# field only v2 binds is signed at v2; an interop invoke receipt, which carries none of
# them, keeps the byte-stable v1 canonical. A call site can still pin a version
# explicitly, but it can no longer under-sign its evidence by omission.

# receipts, the version is derived from content (`resolve_verification_version`): an
