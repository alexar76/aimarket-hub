"""Hub-native MCP JSON-RPC at ``/mcp`` (and ``/ai-market/mcp``).

Peers that read ``mcp_endpoint`` from ``/.well-known/ai-market.json`` need a real
handler — advertising a 404 is a protocol lie. This surface speaks Streamable-HTTP
MCP (JSON-RPC 2.0 POST, SSE ``data:`` framing) with two tools that map onto the
hub's own search + invoke paths.

It is also the endpoint a stranger pastes into an MCP client, which is a different
job from serving a peer, and two things follow from that:

* **The trial tier has to reach them.** This gateway does not invent credit — it
  presents each caller to the hub's own trial ledger under an identity derived from
  their address, and the hub decides what that identity is still allowed. Without it
  the first thing a newcomer met was the payment wall, so the endpoint was reachable
  and useless.
* **The identity must be per caller.** One process serves everybody here; a single
  shared identity would spend the whole allowance on whoever arrived first.

Paid invokes are unchanged: a caller who supplies a payment channel is a customer,
not a visitor, and is never put on the trial tier.

**Why strangers left after tools/list (measured 2026-09-25).** Over 15 days about 240
foreign MCP clients fetched the tool list and two called a tool. A model calls a tool
when the user's task matches its name and description; "search a capability catalogue"
matches no task, the catalogue behind it was invisible, and ``initialize`` said nothing
about what the server is for. So the gateway now also sends ``instructions``, lists a
few DIRECT tools named after the need they serve (``weather_now`` …) whenever this hub
can route them, gives search results the input fields a call needs, and answers with a
compact result instead of 9 KB of which 7 KB was post-quantum signature. The funnel is
counted per method and client family (``aimarket_hub_mcp_requests_total``), so the next
question of this kind is answered by a metric rather than by reverse-engineering nginx
response sizes.
