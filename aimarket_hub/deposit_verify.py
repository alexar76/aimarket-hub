"""On-chain deposit verification for a hub that ships without the web app behind it.

The canonical verifier lives in ``web.backend.services.ai_market_protocol.on_chain``, and
a standalone hub image cannot import it: that package's ``__init__`` pulls in the whole
web stack (catalog, discovery, pricing, invoke, pipelines…). So on such a hub
``_shared_on_chain("verify_tx_payment_details")`` returns ``None``, ``_verify_tx_onchain``
answers "on-chain verification unavailable", and **every paid channel/open is refused**.

That is correct fail-closed behaviour and it is also a total revenue block on the
deposit-funded door. Measured on modelmarket.dev, 2026-09-07: ``AIFACTORY_PROD=1``, stub
off, verifier unimportable (``No module named 'web'``) — the escrow-funded door worked
(all 13 channels ever opened there came through it, ``tx_hash`` empty), and the deposit
door had never once succeeded.

This module is that door's verifier, self-contained: JSON-RPC in, a verdict out.

What it will and will not certify
---------------------------------
* **Stablecoin transfers only.** A deposit quoted in USD can only be checked against a
  token whose unit IS the dollar. This ecosystem deliberately has no price oracle (same
  stance as ``onchain_reads`` in the monitor and the web verifier), so a deposit paid in
  the chain's native coin is REFUSED rather than converted at a guessed rate.
* **The payer is the ERC-20 ``Transfer.from``**, not the transaction's origin: the caller
  binds the channel to it (PAYAUTH-003), and a transfer routed through a contract is paid
  by whoever the token moved from.
* **One payer per deposit.** Matching transfers from two different senders in one
  transaction are refused as ambiguous rather than credited to the first.
* Anything unreadable — no receipt, reverted status, too few confirmations, an
  unresolvable token address, an RPC that will not answer — is a refusal. A verifier that
  cannot see the chain must never say "verified".
