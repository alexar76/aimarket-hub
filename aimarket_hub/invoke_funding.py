"""Who pays for one invoke, and under whose limits — the mandate and subcontracting layer.

``api.py``'s invoke handler already knows how to reserve, capture and release money on the
credits rail, on its local branch, its federated branch and for the routing fee. This module
decides, BEFORE that handler runs, whether the request is mandated (mandates.md §5), part
of a job (§6.1) or paid from a job's allowance (§6.2), and hands the handler two things:

* the funding account, when it is not the one an X-API-Key would name;
* a ledger to use instead of the plain credits ledger for this one request
  (:class:`~aimarket_hub.mandates.MandatedCredits` or
  :class:`~aimarket_hub.subcontract.AllowanceCredits`).

AFTER the handler, it closes what the request opened: the job node, the allowance and its
mandate reservation, and adds the bill of materials to the answer. Keeping this outside the
handler is deliberate — the handler is two thousand lines with a dozen exits, and a layer
that must run on every one of them belongs around it, not inside it.
