"""C3 signing strategies — the only place in the hub that can put value in motion.

Three strategies, ordered by how much trust they need:

    plan      the default. Refuses to sign anything. Everything upstream of a signature
              still runs (build, simulate, record), so plan mode is genuinely useful: it
              proves an authorization WOULD be accepted, and surfaces a nonce gap, an
              expired deadline or an insufficient balance, without a transaction existing.
    external  hands an unsigned transaction to an operator-run signer and takes back a
              hash. No key material enters this process, which is the point.
    env       signs in-process with a key read from the environment. Most capable, least
              contained; gated hardest.

Two rules hold across all three:

* Nothing signs unless :func:`config.submit_policy` says so — mode, strategy AND the
  explicit confirmation phrase. A refusal raises SubmissionRefused BEFORE a transaction is
  built, so the caller's pending record is untouched and safe to retry.
* A returned transaction hash is never taken as proof of anything. The mirror confirms by
  reading the chain, so a broken or hostile signer can at worst do nothing — it cannot
  convince the hub that money moved.
