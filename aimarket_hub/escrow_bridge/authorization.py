"""C2 — accept a buyer's DebitAuthorization, or refuse the invoke.

The contract will only debit a channel against a signature from its depositor, so this is
where the hub earns the right to be paid: an invoke that runs without a stored, verified
authorization is work the hub can never collect for on chain.

Every check here answers a question the CONTRACT will ask later, and answers it before the
provider does any billable work — so a mismatch costs a 402, not an unpaid delivery:

    signer      == channels[channelId].depositor   (read from the chain, not claimed)
    hub         == this hub's configured address   (the contract binds it into the digest)
    token       == the channel's token
    amount      == the cents the ledger is about to debit, converted exactly
    receiptId   == the ledger's own receipt nonce for this debit
    nonce       == the channel's CURRENT on-chain nonce
    deadline     in the future, and not absurdly far in it

Refusals raise AuthorizationRejected with a message meant for the buyer's client, because
"your authorization is wrong" is only actionable if it says which field.
