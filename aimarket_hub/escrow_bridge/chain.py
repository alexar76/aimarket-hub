"""Read-only view of AIMarketEscrow, plus calldata the mirror can simulate.

Nothing in this module signs or sends anything — it only reads and encodes. That split is
deliberate: C1 (funding verification) and the mirror's plan mode need exactly these
capabilities and no more, so the code path that a channel open depends on cannot broadcast
even if the submission policy is misconfigured.

Transport is the hub's existing ``chain_net`` pool (priority-ordered endpoints, failover
on transport errors, JSON-RPC errors surfaced rather than retried), so the bridge inherits
the RPC configuration operators already use instead of introducing a second one.

The ``getChannel`` decoding below was verified against a live deployment on a local anvil:
the struct is nine consecutive 32-byte words in the order declared in
``contracts/evm/src/AIMarketEscrow.sol`` (depositor, hub, token, depositAmount, balance,
usedAmount, expiresAt, nonce, status).
