"""C3 — the reconciler that turns stored authorizations into on-chain debits.

This is what actually closes audit finding #9: without it ``usedAmount`` stays 0 forever
and a depositor can reclaim a fully consumed deposit. Everything here is a background /
operator action, never part of a request: an invoke records an authorization and returns,
and the mirror catches up afterwards.

Order is the load-bearing property. The escrow accepts a debit only at the channel's
CURRENT nonce, so authorizations must go out strictly in ascending nonce per channel. A gap
therefore BLOCKS rather than skips — skipping would leave a permanently unsubmittable row
behind, i.e. money the hub can never collect.

Four guards sit in front of every submission, in this order, because each is cheaper than
the next and each can only refuse:

    0. the chain's replay flag      — has this receipt already been collected, by anyone?
    1. the store's queue position   — is this the next nonce for its channel?
    2. the LEDGER                   — did the hub actually debit this receipt, for this much?
    3. the chain                    — would the contract accept it right now? (simulation)

Guard 0 is first for two reasons, both learned the hard way in production on 2026-07-29.
A receipt the operator collected by hand leaves the row unresolved forever, and since
submission is strictly nonce-ordered that one row blocks every later row on its channel —
so it must resolve before the queue guard can refuse it. And it must resolve before the
DEADLINE guard, or a debit that was collected on time gets recorded as money the hub can
never collect, which is the opposite of the truth.

Guard 2 matters more than it looks: the store holds what the BUYER signed, and the ledger
holds what the hub actually charged. Submitting the signed amount without checking would
let a hub bug (or a tampered store) collect more on chain than it billed off chain.
