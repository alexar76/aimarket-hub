"""Durable record of every DebitAuthorization the hub holds.

Its own SQLite file, with its own schema bootstrap, on purpose: the bridge is optional, so
its tables must not ride the hub's migration chain (which the channel ledger pins by
subsystem) and an operator who never enables the bridge must not acquire its schema.

``receipt_id`` is the primary key because it is the CONTRACT's replay key
(``usedReceipts``): keying on the same value the chain keys on means the store and the
chain cannot disagree about what "the same debit" is. It is also the ledger's receipt
nonce, so one row ties together the off-chain debit, the buyer's signature, and the
on-chain submission.

State machine — a row only ever moves forward:

    pending ──plan ok──▶ planned ──submit──▶ submitted ──receipt──▶ confirmed  (terminal)
       │                    │                    │
       └───────── abandoned ◀────────────────────┘                            (terminal)

A simulation that reverts does NOT move the row: the revert is recorded as the last known
plan and the row stays where it was, because most reverts here are transient by nature (a
nonce gap that a preceding submission will fill, a chain that was unreachable). Only an
operator decision, or a permanently unusable authorization, abandons a row — and an
abandoned row means the hub has no on-chain claim to that money, never that the buyer is
charged twice.
