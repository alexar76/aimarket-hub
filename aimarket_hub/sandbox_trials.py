"""Widget sandbox trials — free invoke quota per visitor (escrow-free preview).

Used by embed widgets and demos: visitors get N complimentary invocations without
opening a payment channel. Production invocations still debit channels normally.

Env:
  AIMARKET_SANDBOX_ENABLED — "0" disables sandbox (default: enabled)
  AIMARKET_SANDBOX_MAX_PER_VISITOR — trials per visitor id (default 3)
  AIMARKET_SANDBOX_QUOTA_WINDOW — "lifetime" (default) or "daily"/"hourly"/"weekly".
      lifetime is the revenue setting: three invokes ever, then pay. A repeating window
      is the engagement setting: the allowance comes back, so a returning agent keeps
      using the hub between purchases. Switch it without touching the ledger — counters
      are keyed by window, so changing the value starts a fresh period rather than
      forgiving or double-charging what was already spent.
  AIMARKET_SANDBOX_MAX_PER_IP_HOUR — rate cap per client IP (default 30)
  AIMARKET_SANDBOX_STUB_INVOKE — "1" returns deterministic demo output when factory is down

Runtime overrides: the same three dials can be set in ``data/sandbox_trial_policy.json``
so the free tier can be retuned without recreating the container. A dial you can only
turn by redeploying is not much of a dial, and this one is a revenue/engagement setting
someone will want to move while watching traffic. Environment always wins over the file,
so an explicit ops decision cannot be overridden by a stray config.
