"""Buying credits with USDC — the one self-serve way money enters the credits rail.

Everything else on the credits rail (mandates, subcontracting allowances, A2A and REST
invokes paid with ``X-API-Key``) needs credit on an account, and until this module only the
operator could put it there (``POST /accounts/{id}/credit``). A stranger's agent could open an
account but never fund it. This is the door that lets it.

The flow is the x402 "exact" scheme the hub already speaks for seller-direct sales, pointed at
the operator instead of a seller:

1. **Quote.** ``POST /ai-market/v2/account/topup`` with the account's ``X-API-Key`` and
   ``{"amount_usd": 5}`` answers ``402`` with ordinary x402 terms: pay ``amount`` USDC to
   ``payTo`` by an EIP-3009 ``transferWithAuthorization`` signed over the ``nonce`` in the
   offer. The nonce is random, minted here, and bound in ``credit_topup_quotes`` to that
   account and that amount.
2. **Pay.** The buyer signs the authorization with its own wallet and sends the transaction
   itself. The hub holds no key, submits nothing and pays no gas.
3. **Redeem.** The buyer (or anyone) presents the transaction hash. The hub reads the chain:
   the token logged ``AuthorizationUsed(payer, nonce)`` and, in its very next log, moved at
   least the quoted amount from that payer to ``payTo`` (``settle.verify_transfer`` — the
   same definition of "paid" the market rail uses). Then it credits the QUOTED account.

**Why redemption needs no secret — unlike an invoke.** The seller-direct rail binds a nonce
to a secret only the payer holds (``settle.nonce_for_secret``), because an invoke is service
to whoever presents the payment: a watcher who saw the mined transaction could redeem it
first and take the call. A top-up is not service to the presenter. The account is fixed when
the quote is minted, so presenting someone else's payment only credits *their* account, once.
Requiring a secret here would protect nothing and would strand the money of a buyer who lost
it; so redemption is open to anyone holding the transaction hash, and the hub could redeem on
the buyer's behalf.

**One payment, one credit — across every door.** A transfer to the operator's wallet is also
what the channel-deposit door accepts. Before crediting, a redemption claims the transaction
in the shared deposit-claim registry (``deposit_claims``), the same single-use record the
channel door and the Factory write, and records the authorization in ``x402_payments``. Each
step is idempotent on the quote's nonce, so a redemption interrupted halfway is finished by
the next one, and two racing redemptions credit once.

Off unless ``AIMARKET_TOPUP_ENABLED=1``: it is a door money comes in through, and an operator
opens it on purpose. Operator guide: ``docs/credits-topup.md``.
