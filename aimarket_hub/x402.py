"""x402 interoperability — speak the payment dialect the rest of the agent web speaks.

Why this exists: x402 became a Linux Foundation standard in July 2026, and every official
SDK, every Bazaar index and a growing set of edge platforms speak it. This hub already
answers `402` with everything a payer needs — a price, a recipient, a chain — but in its own
shape, which no x402 client can read. Emitting the same facts in x402's format costs
nothing and makes the hub reachable by clients nobody here has to write.

**Version.** x402 shipped V2 (`x402Version: 2`) and moved its payload out of the response
body into a base64 `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header; V1 kept it in the body under `accepts`. Live
facilitators still advertise V1 kinds, so this module emits BOTH: the V2 header, and the V1
fields merged additively into the body the hub already returns. An existing consumer reading
`success` / `error` / `detail` / `needed` sees no change.

**Accepting payment.** A payer that sends back a signed EIP-3009 authorization is now
honoured, behind `AIMARKET_X402_ACCEPT=1`, and the split of responsibilities is worth
stating because it is what keeps this honest:

* **Verification is local and complete.** The authorization is checked against the terms
  this hub advertised — scheme, network, asset, recipient, amount, validity window — and
  the signature is recovered from the EIP-3009 digest, so an authorization for somebody
  else's address, another chain, a smaller amount or an expired window is refused before
  any work happens. Nonces are single-use in this hub's ledger, so a replay buys nothing.
* **Settlement is not.** Submitting `transferWithAuthorization` needs an RPC and gas, and
  it happens out of band exactly like the escrow bridge's sweep. Until it lands, the
  authorization is a RECEIVABLE, published as `x402_unsettled_usd`. A verified signature is
  not proof the payer's balance covers it — only the chain is — so an operator who cannot
  tolerate that gap should leave `AIMARKET_X402_ACCEPT` off and take credits instead.

The gap is bounded rather than hand-waved: `AIMARKET_X402_MAX_UNSETTLED_USD` caps how much
unsettled authorization the hub will hold in total before it stops accepting more.
