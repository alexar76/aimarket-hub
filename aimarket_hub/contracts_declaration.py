"""What this hub has ON CHAIN — published so a stranger can go and look.

A hub's ``/.well-known/ai-market.json`` used to say ``supported_chains: ["base"]``,
``payment_configured: true`` and a price list, and not one address. So "this hub settles
on Base" was a claim with nothing behind it: a reader could not open the escrow, could
not see a single transaction, and could not tell a hub that has been settling for months
from one switched on this morning. The only way to find out was to send it money.

This module publishes the two things that are checkable without trusting us at all:

  * ``escrow``  — the contract this hub settles payment channels through, and
  * ``wallet``  — the address its invoices are actually paid to,

plus the settlement token, each with the chain id and an explorer link. None of it is a
new disclosure: the escrow address appears in every channel open, and the recipient in
every x402 ``accepts[].payTo`` this hub has ever answered with. Publishing them only
means a reader no longer has to buy something to learn them.

**Nothing here is configured separately, deliberately.** The addresses are read from the
payment configuration and deployment registry the hub already runs with, so a hub that
deploys an escrow starts declaring it on its next request, and one that has none declares
nothing at all. There is no switch to forget and no second place to update — which is the
only reason the declaration can be trusted to still be true after a redeploy.

Two guards, because this is the one part of the well-known that names money:

*Realm seal.* Addresses come from :func:`chain_net.active_network`, which in the UNI
realm is the bubble's own Anvil deployment (``assert_sealed`` runs on every resolve).
:func:`realm.check_addresses` is called again on what we are about to publish, so a sealed
realm cannot publish a mainnet address even by accident.

*Readiness.* The wallet is published only when :attr:`HubConfig.payment_ready` — the same
condition that already gates ``payment_configured``. A hub that credits any ``tx_hash``
without checking it has no business pointing at a wallet as if money arriving there meant
anything.

The mirror side is :func:`sanitize`, which validates the same structure coming back from
somebody ELSE's well-known. A peer's declaration is a claim about addresses, and the whole
point is that a claim about an address is checkable — so it is stored and re-exported
verbatim-but-bounded, and verified against the chain by whoever draws it.
