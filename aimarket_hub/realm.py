"""The realm seal — UNI is a sealed bubble, and nothing inside it can reach a real chain.

UNI is not "crypto off". It is a parallel chain of our own (Anvil, chain id 31337, our
contracts, a USD-pegged token funded from nowhere) whose whole point is that from inside it
behaves exactly like the live economy: real signatures, real contracts, real escrow, real
slashing, real receipts. Two properties follow, and only one of them is achievable by
wishing:

**No escape (absolute, enforced here).** Nothing configured inside UNI may name a real
chain, a real contract, a real token or a public RPC. This is not a convention — every one
of those was a live leak before this module existed:

* ``chain_net`` defaults ``base`` to real public RPC endpoints AND auto-loads
  ``deployments/base-mainnet.json``, so a hub told "you are on base" inside a bubble read
  and wrote against Base mainnet addresses over the public internet;
* the x402 asset table hard-codes the REAL Base USDC contract and ``eip155:8453``, so a
  402 issued inside the bubble handed every participant a payment offer valid on mainnet.
  An agent inside with a funded real key could sign it, and that signature settles on Base.
  That is money leaving the bubble, which is the exact thing that must be impossible.

**Indistinguishability (behavioural, and stated honestly).** Display names, API shapes,
receipts and flows are identical to LIVE — nothing in any public payload says "uni". What
cannot be hidden is ``chainId``: a participant who signs anything needs it, because it is
inside the EIP-712 domain separator. So an inside agent can always *read* which chain it is
on; what it can never do is act outside. Claiming otherwise would be a lie told by
software, and the seal is worth more than the illusion.

The same separator is what makes the two realms non-interchangeable in both directions: a
signature made for 31337 is invalid on 8453 and vice versa. The seal is belt and braces on
top of that arithmetic, for the parts that are not signed — RPC hosts, contract addresses,
token identities.

Default realm is ``live``, so an existing deployment behaves exactly as before.

# with the SIX REAL satellites and their pinned public keys, and `_parse_seed_list` falls back
# to that file whenever `AIMARKET_SEED_LIST` is empty — which is what the bubble was deployed
# with. Two consequences, both live:
#
#   * the bubble PUBLISHED the real ecosystem's hostnames in its own
#     `/.well-known/ai-market.json` under `federation.seed_list`. An agent inside the bubble
#     could read the exact addresses of the world outside it. That is a door in the wall.
#   * a single operator crawl would have indexed real, outside-reachable, priced endpoints
#     into the bubble's catalogue, and those seed keys are pinned for trusted-on-first-contact
#     indexing — so no approval step would have stood in the way. A bubble invoke would then
#     have routed real money to a real provider.
#
# Hence: inside UNI the committed seed file is DROPPED, not filtered — it is the live
# ecosystem's address book and nothing in it can ever be inside a bubble — and an explicitly
# configured seed must name a host the bubble itself answers on.
