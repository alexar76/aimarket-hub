"""Federated slash synchronization + portable proof-of-misbehavior (F2 / F6).

Today a slash in hub A leaves the agent's standing in hub B untouched — reputation does not
cross the federation, so a cheater just moves hubs. This module closes that gap **without a
central authority**:

* A hub that slashes a bond emits a **signed ``SlashAttestation``** to an append-only,
  per-issuer, monotonically-sequenced log.
* Peers pull each other's logs and **verify the issuer's signature** before storing — a hub
  cannot forge another hub's attestation.
* The reputation score consumes the **union** of local + remote slashes, so misbehavior
  anywhere lowers the agent's score everywhere.

Critical defense (F6): a cross-hub slash is fully trusted only when it carries a **portable
proof-of-misbehavior** — the original dispute *signed by the wronged consumer*. Without it a
malicious hub could poison a competitor's agents by emitting fake slashes.

Two evidence tiers (consensus > one hub's mood):

* **strong** — carries a verifiable consumer-signed PoM. One strong issuer is enough to move
  the federated penalty (the consumer's signature is independently checkable anywhere).
* **weak** — issuer-signed only (e.g. an automated invoke-failure or verified-failure slash,
  optionally carrying self-verifying ``evidence`` such as a signed verification_rejection
  receipt). A single weak issuer NEVER moves the penalty; it takes at least two *distinct*
  hubs independently attesting — cross-hub consensus — and even then each weak issuer
  counts as half a strong one. ``ingest_remote(accept_weak=True)`` opts a hub into storing
  the weak tier at all.

The tier is decided by EVIDENCE, never by authorship. A hub's own slashes are classified with
the same rule its peers apply: PoM present and verifiable → strong, otherwise weak. This hub's
automated ladders (invoke-failure, verified-failure, self-bond breach) carry no consumer-signed
PoM and are therefore weak *locally too* — so a handful of induced failures on one hub cannot
move ``federated_penalty`` by itself, which is exactly what "a lone weak issuer moves nothing"
is supposed to mean. A first-hand operator dispute that DOES carry a verifiable consumer PoM
(``reputation_oracle.resolve_dispute``) still counts fully. For the same reason every
missing/blank tier — an envelope reloaded from an older row, a key never recorded — defaults to
**weak**, never to strong: an unknown tier is not evidence. Rows persisted by the older
authorship rule are re-judged on load: a stored ``strong`` whose envelope carries no PoM at all
is downgraded to weak, so upgrading the code actually retires the inflated penalties instead of
grandfathering them.

The registry is durably backed by the ``slash_attestations`` table when constructed with a
database: the authored log (and its monotonic ``seq``) survives restarts — an append-only
log that forgets on reboot is not append-only.
