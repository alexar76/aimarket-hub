"""Post-quarantine federation assay: sandbox evidence, then automatic admission.

A knock lands ``pending``. This module then:

1. Hard-checks the host (public URL, schema, Ed25519 self-consistency, origin).
2. Probes up to three public free capabilities in a bounded sandbox POST, stopping
   at the first that answers with a signed receipt (factory idea: score the *running*
   output, not the brochure — see product_automated_verify). The endpoint comes from
   `federation_transport`, the same rule routed invokes use.
3. Analyses that payload (safety gate + schema + optional LLM *veto* on the
   evidence JSON). Names and descriptions are stripped before any model sees it.
4. On ``pass`` **and** a configured judge token, admits the peer (``trusted`` +
   crawl). Without a token a pass is only a scorecard — the operator Approves.

An LLM that is handed well-known copy will rubber-stamp it. The judge is
therefore veto-only and receives the sandbox result, never ``name``/``description``.
