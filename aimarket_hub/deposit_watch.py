"""USDC that lands in the hub's top-up wallet is credited without anybody presenting it.

Until 2026-10-04 a top-up became credit only when somebody POSTed ``/topups/{nonce}`` with the
transaction hash, and a plain transfer — what a person sends from an ordinary wallet app — could
only be credited by the operator by hand (``/accounts/{id}/credit`` with ``tx_hash``). The first
company-to-company payment (Independent AI prepaying its account at Attested Memory) needed exactly
that hand step, and somebody watching the chain to know it had arrived.

Now the hub watches its own top-up wallet, every ``AIMARKET_DEPOSIT_WATCH_INTERVAL_S``:

* a transfer whose transaction carries an ``AuthorizationUsed`` for an open top-up quote is
  redeemed exactly as ``POST /topups/{nonce}`` would — nobody has to present it;
* a plain transfer from a wallet LINKED to an account is credited to that account as paid credit
  (``POST /account/payer-wallets``: the account proves it controls the wallet with a signature, or
  the operator links it);
* anything else is recorded as an unattributed deposit, listed for the operator
  (``GET /admin/deposits``), counted in the well-known (so an alerter can page) and credited the
  moment its sender is linked.

Only a wallet that receives top-ups and NOTHING ELSE can be watched this way
(``AIMARKET_TOPUP_PAY_TO``). The hub's x402 wallet also receives sales, and its payment-recipient
wallet channel deposits; reading every incoming transfer as a top-up would credit those twice. So
the watcher refuses to run on either.

Every credit goes through the deposit registry every door shares (``channels.claim_deposit_as``)
and the ledger's idempotent reference ``chain:<chain>:<tx>`` — the same reference the operator's
hand credit uses — so a transaction becomes credit once, whichever door sees it first.

**No transfer holds up the others** (independent review, 2026-10-04). Every transfer seen is
recorded on its own row and the cursor moves on: one that cannot be decided yet (a quote over its
account's daily limit, a node that has no receipt yet, a registry that did not answer) is
``pending`` and retried from that row on later scans; one nobody can claim is ``unattributed``
and re-examined — a link, the operator's hand credit or a quote presented by hand settles it. Only
a node that cannot be read at all stops a scan, and then the same blocks are read again.
