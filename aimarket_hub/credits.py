"""Credits — the payment rail that works with the chain switched off.

Why this exists. Before this module the hub had exactly one way to be paid: a payment
channel funded on Base. Reaching it takes six configuration interlocks
(``config.py`` :meth:`HubConfig.crypto_preflight_errors`), an ``AIMarketEscrow`` the
operator must deploy and own — ``debitChannel`` gates on ``authorizedHubs[msg.sender]``,
so the address shipped in ``deployments/base-mainnet.json`` is unusable by anyone but its
owner — and a deposit verifier (``channels._verify_tx_onchain``) that is not even present
in the hub wheel or its Docker image. The practical consequence, measured rather than
guessed: a stranger who deploys this hub serves every invoke for free, because
``AIFACTORY_CRYPTO_ENABLED`` defaults to ``0`` and with it off ``price`` is forced to
``0.0``. A node that cannot be paid is a node nobody runs twice.

So: one env var (``AIMARKET_CREDITS_ENABLED=1``), no chain, no contract, no wallet.
A buyer gets an API key, the operator credits it (by hand, or via a checkout the operator
wires up), and invokes debit it. That is the whole rail.

**Millicents, not cents.** The channel ledger bills in whole cents rounded UP
(``channels._dollars_to_cents_bill``), so the ecosystem's own measured average price of
$0.0059 bills as $0.01 — a ~70% overcharge — and nothing below a cent can be priced at
all. Agent capabilities are priced in tenths of a cent. This ledger's unit is a
**millicent** (1/1000 of a cent, i.e. $0.00001), so $0.0059 is 590mc exactly and stays
exact through hold → capture.

**Custody, stated plainly.** A prepaid balance is the operator physically holding a
buyer's money, exactly like the transfer-funded channel path (``channels`` ACCT-001).
Nothing here can send value either: :func:`stats` publishes ``outstanding_credit_usd`` so
the liability is a number the operator can see and a buyer can ask about, and refunds are
an operator action, not an automatic one. Do not switch this on for balances you are not
prepared to honour.

**The hold contract is the channel ledger's contract**, deliberately: the invoke path's
reserve-before-execute invariant (auth/capture) must behave identically on either rail, so
``hold`` / ``capture_hold`` / ``release_hold`` return the same ``{"error": ...}`` or
``{"remaining_balance": ...}`` shapes and the same "already resolved is a no-op" rule.
