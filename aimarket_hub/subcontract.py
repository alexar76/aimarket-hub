"""Subcontracting — a provider that buys from another provider while serving a call.

Normative text: ``aimarket-protocol/mandates.md`` §6. This module is the reference
implementation.

Before this, a provider that called the hub from inside its own invocation was just another
anonymous buyer: its purchase had no link to the call it was serving, no budget from the
buyer who started the work, no depth limit and no place in any receipt. A chain of agents
hiring agents was invisible to the market, and nothing stopped A → B → A → B.

Two mechanisms, deliberately separate:

* **The job token** (``X-AIMarket-Job``) is linkage only. The hub signs it and sends it to
  every local provider it executes; a provider that sends it back on a purchase gets that
  purchase recorded as a child in the job tree, with depth, cycle and fan-out limits. It
  carries no money, so a provider paying for its own subcontractors (fixed price) needs
  nothing else.
* **The grant** (``X-AIMarket-Job-Grant``) is money: a bearer secret for a pass-through
  allowance the ROOT buyer set aside for subcontractors (cost-plus). The allowance is a
  credit hold taken with the root call; a child's price is carved out of it by one
  conditional statement (``CreditsLedger.transfer_hold``), so children can never spend more
  than the allowance however many run at once, and a failed child's money flows back into
  the allowance for a retry.

Both are local-execution features: the hub can only link calls it executes and pass through
money it meters.
