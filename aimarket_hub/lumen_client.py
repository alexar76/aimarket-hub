"""LUMEN trust oracle client — PageRank/EigenTrust over the supply trust graph.

Every non-healthy return distinguishes TWO failure classes, because the caller must treat
them differently (see ``supply_security.refresh_publisher_trust``):

* ``unavailable=True`` — the oracle could not be consulted or answered nonsense (HTTP
  error, malformed payload, transport failure, non-finite score). Nothing is known about
  the entity, so the caller must NOT overwrite a stored score and must not gate on a
  manufactured one.
* ``unavailable=False`` with a ``no_edges``/``empty_graph`` reason — the oracle was not
  needed: the trust graph simply carries no signal about anyone yet. Deterministic and
  reproducible, which is what lets a brand-new publisher bootstrap.

In both cases ``score`` is ``None``. This client used to answer *every* failure with a
manufactured ``score: 0.5`` — above both the discover (0.25) and invoke (0.35) gates — so
an oracle outage silently granted passing trust to every publisher, including one that had
just been slashed. Inventing a number here is what made that fail-open possible, so the
number is gone.
