"""Classify an invoke for the live ticker: delivered, missed, or incomplete input.

A peer that answers ``ok: false`` with ``lat/lon required`` did its job, and so did
the hub that routed to it. Recording that as ``success=0`` made ATLAS look like it
was failing, and the storefront percentage (``98.1% успех``) fell on every sandbox
click that sent ``{text: query}`` instead of coordinates. Those rows still belong on
the tape — they are traffic — but they are neither a provider miss nor a refusal by
this hub, and they are counted as neither.

``ok``         — work delivered.
``fail``       — usable input, provider did not deliver (empty coverage, 5xx, timeout).
``incomplete`` — the CALLER did not send what the capability needs. Its own mark on
                 the tape, its own counter in the summary, and outside the success
                 rate entirely: nobody refused anything and nothing was missed.
``refused``    — this hub or the provider declined on policy (quota, plan, blocked
                 consumer). Kept as a separate class because it IS a decision someone
                 made, unlike ``incomplete``, which is a malformed request.

Only ``ok`` and ``fail`` are scored.

    A list of GROUPS, not of names, because a capability may legitimately have more than

    stored ``watchbox_id`` plus its ``owner_token``, OR a bare ``west/south/east/north``
    bbox — a flat ``required`` list cannot express that, so the schema carried the rule in
    its prose description and nothing could act on it. Read as alternatives, the answer to
    an empty request is "requires watchbox_id, owner_token or west, south, east, north",
    which is the sentence a caller can actually fix.

    Satisfying ANY alternative means nothing is missing. Top-level ``required`` is checked
    as well, and independently: a field required on every branch is required.

    ``[]`` is also the answer when the schema declares no requirement at all. That is not a
    gap to paper over — a capability that names nothing has given no basis to judge, and
    guessing on its behalf would refuse calls it would have served.
